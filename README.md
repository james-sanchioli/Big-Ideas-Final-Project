## Metrics
### 311 Reports - James Sanchioli
Taking all the 311 Reports in the Pittsburgh Area and compairing the amounts against neighborhoods. 

### City of Pittsburgh Trees - Tristan Zuroski
An analysis of quantity of trees per neighborhood, including some investigation of tree quality.

*** Supermarkets and Convenience Stores - Shivangi Tiwari
Understanding where the density of supermarket and convenience stores, describing access to food at convenience and health wise. 

## Conclusions
From the datasets pure values, it is a tie between Squirl Hill South and South Side Flats, however we do not feel there is any real conclusions that can be made with these data sets. Due to the abnormal nature of the 311 report density and the Grocery/Convienvce Store locations, the only reliable data set will be the Trees.
